How to use it?

Avatar Pen have a few customizations and features which will make your life better in case if there is no pen under your hand!
To start drawing you will need to go to your Pen Menu and Toggle it on, then you will need to make a Point Gesture with your Right Hand and start drawingðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰

You will be able to control it's Width and Color in case if you don't them. Simply go to Hue or Width Radial menu and change it's values to something you like!

Pause toggle will not allow you to draw anymore until you will untoggle it. Useful if you want to keep your drawing around but not to use the Pen at the moment.

Erase toggle, as it says, will erase all you have drawn and you can start drawing again.
